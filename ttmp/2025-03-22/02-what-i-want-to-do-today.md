Today I want to:

- setup a test imap server and populate it with interesting emails
  - [x] get a docker compose setup with a test user that has a set of mailboxes with mail in them
  - [x] generate interesting mail (HOW?)
    - LATER: generate attachments for the interesting email
    - [ ] support multiple config files at once
    - [ ] what is this pick thing for / go deeper into useful sprig functions
  - [ ] store the generated mail in IMAP box

- once I have the server running I want to use it to test smailnail and different complex rules


- implement nested logical rules in my DSL
- implement actions in my DSL as well
